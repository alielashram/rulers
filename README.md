# Rulers

This is a basic sample gem that was made based upon the Rebuilding Rails Handbook

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rulers'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rulers

## Usage

This gems acts much the same as the rails gem does but with much less functionality. Currently it is only able to start a server, run some tests, and do some basic routing.
